# ENVI5809-Phytoplankton

## Scientific questions
- To determine whether phytoplankton has a strong correlation to temperature, or if the correlation is stronger to other tested variables. 
- To determine the directionality of that correlation over time at 5 sites along the Great Barrier Reef, supposing an inverse relationship and a general poleward shift of phytoplankton as temperature increases southward

## Summary of Analysis
Preliminary analysis aims to determine the depth of peak phytoplankton abundance at all sites and then determine the suitability of temperature at -0.5m (from the eReefs database) to sea surface temperature from the NOAA database. Correlations run between all variables across the entire study period for each of five study sites are visualised in a matrix. Rate of change of chlorophyll and sea surface temperature across the entire study region over the study period are created and plotted into colourmaps.
